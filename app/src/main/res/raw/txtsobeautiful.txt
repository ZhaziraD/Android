[Verse 1]
I think I've got my sight for you
I don't mean to let it brew
I thought I thought it through
Now come on, you know I just get confused

[Chorus]
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep
I left a message encased in me
So bye-bye (So bye-bye)
A flawless ending
So beautiful (You're so)
You're so

[Verse 2]
Let's take a trip down a dark place, baby
Look for me now, I'm not that crazy
Let's talk about what makes you happy
'Cause I know (I know)
I'm calling for you

[Chorus]
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skiеs can't sleep
I left a message еncased in me
So bye-bye (So bye-bye)
A flawless ending
So beautiful (You're so)


[Bridge]
My love is turning kinda grey
(I love it when you sing)
My heart is looking the other way
My love is turning kinda grey
(I love it when you sing)
My heart is looking the other way

[Chorus]
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep (Yeah)
I left a message encased in me
So bye-bye (So bye-bye)
A flawless ending
Come get your funky love story
I love it when the skies can't sleep (Yeah)
I left a message encased in me
So bye-bye (So bye-bye)
A flawless ending
So beautiful
