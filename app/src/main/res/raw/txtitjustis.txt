[Verse 1: Seori]
사람에게 질려
하루 끝에 난 밀려
이젠 신경 안 써
It must be fine
이렇게 혼자 남아도
결국 흘러갈테니까
Never mind
It must be fine

[Pre-Chorus: Seori]
I didn't wanna play
I didn't wanna date
I didn't wanna say
I just wanna sleep
Until the day before I met you

[Chorus: Seori]
네가 돌아선다면
다가갈게 꼭 잡을게
너만 초대할래
유일하게 내 방 안에
No matter what they say
Oh you always lit my shadow
And the one who shares my sorrow
With you, with you, with you it's different
I don't know why
It just is


[Verse 2: eaJ]
I'm tired of the same line
I heard through every grape vine
Broken records screaming in time
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
People come and pass by
Even though I wished they stay mine
So many brokеn records scream in my m-i-ind
I'll be f-i-inе

[Pre-Chorus: eaJ]
I always pushed away
Always pushed away
Scared they'd go away
So I watched them leave
Didn't say nothing
But with you I think it's different

[Chorus: eaJ]
If you ever tell me you gotta go
I'll be the first to ask you where
If you say you need me no more
Then I might have to stop you there
No matter what they say oh you always lit my shadow
I've let love lose all of my battles
But you
With you, with you, with you, with you
It's different
I don't know
It just is
