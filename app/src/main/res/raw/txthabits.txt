At night I travel
My nerves unravel
It hurts to hide myself from you
With care I held it
Inside I felt it
My favorite pain comes back to me

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you

These blades I'm hiding
Keep safe the tidings
Of bridges crossed that soon collapsed
No fear of falling
Endlessly calling
You make me feel like I'm alone

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you
Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you

Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you
Don't break me
Don't let go
Don't try to leave
Let your habits control you
